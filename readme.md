**1. Introduction**
Building a resume builder application can streamline the process of creating professional resumes. 
Create multi-section resume builder using the Django web framework. Users can fill out personal information, education details, and work experience, and then generate a PDF resume using ReportLab.

**2. Setting Up the Project**
Create a new Django project and app.
Set up the necessary models, forms, and templates for Personal Information, Education, and Work Experience sections.

**3. Building the Resume Sections**
Define models for Personal Information, Education, and Work Experience with appropriate fields.
Create forms for each section using Django's Form classes to facilitate data entry.
Implement views for each section to handle form submission, data validation, and redirection to the next section.

**4. Implementing the Resume Preview**
Set up a view to display a preview of the user's entered resume data.
Create a template to render the preview using the data stored in the models.

**5. Generating PDF using ReportLab**
Develop a view to generate a PDF version of the resume using ReportLab.
Retrieve the user's entered data from the models.
Use ReportLab's canvas module to create PDF content for each section (Personal Information, Education, Work Experience).
Save and return the PDF as an HTTP response.
